## Questions

### Which k works the best?

Four was found to be the optimal value of k.

### Best k accuracy

The best k had an accuraccy of 100% on the test data. This was hard to accept at first. We then recognized that the data generated was 4 ideal clusters.

A confusion matrix will be rendered within the jupyter notebook when it is run. An image of that matrix is also included below.
